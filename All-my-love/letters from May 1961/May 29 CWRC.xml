         <p>Hi Sweetheart,</p>
         <p>Well I was just about ready to give up hope, when I received your letter today. I
            thought it was much more interesting than a grade five composition on communism.</p>
         <p> By the way why did you a head-ache when you wrote me was it 1 because you had been
            tapping the bottle 2 or because I give you a headache? ( Oh I just of something &amp;
            it’s a good thing you did have one.)</p>
         <p> Nothing is new with me either. Sat. I didn’t do much except &amp; get this help the
            boys take the cattle to the pasture. They were really weird &amp; ran as fast as they
            could go. I only went as far as the sixth. (That’s enough for an old woman to run) Sat.
            night I took mom to visit her sister &amp; we stayed until almost 10:30.</p>
         <p> Sunday I went to church &amp; Sunday school. Father Maclean was inspiring as
            usual.<pb/></p>
         <p>2</p>
         <p>To night I had to take Tommy to the doctor’s. He has some kind of infection on his head,
            right in his hair. (No, it isn’t ringworm.)</p>
         <p>Tomorrow night Joan Hart that teaches Billy is coming over for supper, so I will have to
            entertain her somehow.</p>
         <p>Well I am starting to count the days until I see you again. The first week always seem
            so hopeless, but the second one is better. I suppose you won’t have much time for me
            this time because you will have to do a lot of work with the go- karts. Maybe though you
            could find an hour about 1030 some evening- what do you think?</p>
         <p> Well what do you think of these pictures that two of my kids did for me? (You should
            see the rest.) I bet the boys didn’t know I was so pretty.</p>
         <p>I wrote this in bed that’s why its such a mess.</p>
         <p>p.s. write soon. </p>
         <salute>All my love,</salute>
