      <body>
         <p>May 31/61</p>
         <p>Pembroke, Ont.</p>
         <p>Dear Louise,</p>
         <p> I am trying to keep up with you in the letter department but it is keeping me busy. </p>
         <p> Pardon my manners, but I trust you are in good health. I am simply fading away to skin
            + bones. You know how it is. Your last letter the most interesting + well written that I
            have had the pleasure of reading. Keep up the good work.</p>
         <p> Well a short recap of my last three days. Monday we drove seventy miles to <placeName ref="http://geonames.org/5917434" key="Carp Ontario Canada" cert="high">Carp</placeName> for a
            short job. We finished on time for once and got back here about seven o’clock.</p>
         <p> Tuesday we finally got started on the job. At noon the boys decided to move into
            another part. When we got there<pb/></p>
         <p>We didn’t get started back to work until quarter to three. Tuesday night Jerry + I went
            out fishing again. This time we were after trout. But somebody had already beaten us to
            the stream. So we tried another. I caught one rainbow trout (that’s what Jerry called
            it).</p>
         <p> Today we went back to where we left off yesterday. We worked all morning. We finished
            during noon hour. Believe it or not I caught two bass. So far I have not kept any of the
            fish, I don’t know what I would do with them.</p>
         <p> Guess what I went to the show tonight I figured it might do me some good seeing it was
            religious. It was David + Goliath. It was fair, it stuck strictly to the <title ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1845" key="Bible" level="m" cert="high">Bible</title>, as it
            should.<pb/></p>
         <p> I am glad we have such opinions of ourselves. Both discussing a weekend away from home
            and saying its not the way you think, it will be respectable. To tell you the truth I
            think both of them would be fun. If I could only get close to home for a while I would
            be able to do my share on the Go-Karts track. And then I would be able to alternate
            weekends with Pete.</p>
         <p> Sometimes I get browned off with this job. I like the work if you can call it that but
            right now I am living one out of every three weeks and that is the one I am home. All my
            social life family life an you are at home. That is why this job bothers me.</p>
         <p> Well dear that is enough of my troubles as usual everybody else is in bed. So will
            close </p>
         <p>P.S. Continue your strength for over<pb/></p>
         <p>for next weekend. Because I looking forward till then. And please keep the lid on the
            box.</p>
         <p> p.s.s. It’s OK if you go out with Duck.</p>
         <p>All my love,</p>
         <p>XXXXXXX Glen </p>
